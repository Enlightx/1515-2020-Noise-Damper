# 1515-2020-Noise-Damper
Noise Damper for 1515 &amp; 2020 aluminum extrusions for making a 3D Printer easier on the ears

This is a simple 3D Printer part used to raise a 3D Printer away from the desk to avoid vibration noise.
Orginal idea was by the world famous Josef Prusa for his i3 Printers Anti Vibration Feet
Located here http://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/

I have taken the desin and made it to work with aluminium extrsuions based printer (Mini Kossel etc etc)

Currently there are 2 files one each for 1515 and 2020 size extrusions
To note i have tested the 2020 file on 2020 VRail and it works okay.

When printing these files please use the following settings in your slicer !!

Infill = 0%
Perimiters = 3 
Solid Layers = 0
Bottom Layers  = 0

You should then end up with a printed outline then when the printer is rested on the part you get a small amount of bow.
If you find your parts are gettting weak ideally printer in a stronger plastic like Polymax or ABS.
You can also try upping the permiter amount for a stroner part.
